    <h1>The Great Duck Invasion of Bergamo</h1>
    
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>It all started on a misty morning in March 2023, when a delivery truck carrying 10,000 rubber ducks accidentally spilled its cargo into the Serio River. Little did the citizens of Bergamo know that this mishap would lead to one of the most peculiar events in Italian history.</p>
    
    <h2>The Yellow Wave</h2>
    <p>Within days, the rubber ducks had navigated through the city's ancient water system, emerging from fountains, decorative pools, and even some household plumbing. The sight of yellow rubber ducks bobbing in the city's famous Contarini Fountain became an overnight sensation on social media.</p>
    
    <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
    <p>As the ducks continued their peaceful invasion, local artists began incorporating them into their works. Restaurants started serving duck-shaped pasta, and the city's annual carnival featured a parade of citizens dressed as giant rubber ducks.</p>
